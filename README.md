# üèõÔ∏è Tezoro

a game-like learning app where users earn rewards by answering quizzes and challenging others turning study into friendly competition, with real benefits for every correct answer


## DEMO

https://tezoro.vercel.app/

## Overview

We're building a fun, game-like learning app where you earn rewards for answering quizzes and challenging others. Think of it as studying meets competition, and every question you get right brings real benefits

**The Future of Decentralized Learning & Earning**

Tezoro transforms education into a gamified experience where knowledge acquisition directly translates to real rewards. Built for the Core blockchain ecosystem, we're bridging the gap between traditional learning and Web3 incentives.

## üéØ The Problem

### Current State of Education
- **Low Engagement**: Traditional learning platforms struggle to maintain user motivation
- **No Real Rewards**: Learners complete courses but gain nothing tangible
- **Isolated Experience**: Learning happens in silos without community or competition
- **Web2 Limitations**: Centralized platforms control user data and rewards

### Market Opportunity
- **$250B+ Global EdTech Market** growing at 16% annually
- **Web3 Education** is the next frontier with $50B+ potential
- **Gamification** increases learning retention by 60%
- **Tokenized Rewards** create sustainable engagement loops

## üí° The Solution

### Tezoro: Learn-to-Earn Platform
Tezoro combines **interactive quizzes**, **gamified quests**, and **blockchain rewards** to create the most engaging learning experience in Web3.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- **Earn While You Learn**: Complete quizzes and quests to earn Yuzu Points
- **Competitive Learning**: Real-time leaderboards drive engagement
- **Seasonal Rewards**: Structured competitions with clear incentives
- **Web3 Native**: Seamless wallet integration and on-chain rewards

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```

### Smart Contract Integration
- **Token1.sol**: ERC-20 reward token for the Tezoro ecosystem
- **QuizGame.sol**: On-chain quiz management and reward distribution
- **QuizDuel.sol**: PvP battle system with escrow and reward distribution  
- **GuildSystem.sol**: Guild formation, treasury management, and group battles

- **Farcaster Integration**: Social learning with Frame SDK

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core Learning System
users (wallet_address, total_points, quizzes_completed)
quizzes (title, category, difficulty, questions, points_reward)
quiz_attempts (user_id, quiz_id, score, points_earned)

-- Gamification Layer
quests (title, category, points_reward, requirements)
leaderboard_entries (user_id, season_id, rank, points)
seasons (name, start_date, end_date, is_active)

-- PvP Duel System
quiz_duels (id, challenger_id, opponent_id, topic, entry_fee, status, winner_id)
duel_results (duel_id, user_id, score, time_spent, rewards_earned)
```

## üîó Smart Contracts

### Contract Architecture
All smart contracts are deployed on **Core Testnet2** (Chain ID: 1114) for fast, low-cost transactions.

#### **Token1.sol** - Reward Token
```solidity
// ERC-20 token for Tezoro ecosystem rewards
contract Token1 is ERC20 {
    mapping(address => bool) public authorizedMinters;
    
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount) external {
        require(authorizedMinters[msg.sender], "Not authorized");
        _mint(to, amount);
    }
}
```

#### **QuizGame.sol** - Solo Quiz System
```solidity
// On-chain quiz management with instant rewards
contract QuizGame {
    mapping(address => uint256) public userScores;
    mapping(string => Quiz) public quizzes;
    
    function startQuiz(string memory quizId, uint256 answer) external payable {
        // Entry fee validation and initial token minting
        require(msg.value >= QUIZ_ENTRY_FEE, "Insufficient entry fee");
        token.mint(msg.sender, INITIAL_REWARD);
    }
    
    function completeQuiz(uint256 finalAnswer) external {
        // Score validation and bonus token distribution
        uint256 bonus = calculateBonus(msg.sender, finalAnswer);
        token.mint(msg.sender, bonus);
    }
}
```

#### **QuizDuel.sol** - PvP Battle System
```solidity
// Real-time PvP duels with commit-reveal scheme
contract QuizDuel {
    struct Duel {
        address challenger;
        address opponent;
        uint256 entryFee;
        uint256 prizePool;
        DuelState state;
    }
    
    function startDuel(address opponent, uint256 stake) external payable {
        // Create duel with entry fees
        require(msg.value >= MIN_ENTRY_FEE, "Insufficient stake");
        duels[duelId] = Duel(msg.sender, opponent, msg.value, msg.value * 2, DuelState.Active);
    }
    
    function submitAnswer(bytes32 hashedAnswer) external {
        // Commit-reveal implementation for fair play
        commitments[msg.sender] = hashedAnswer;
    }
    
    function revealAnswer(uint256 answer, bytes32 salt) external {
        // Reveal and determine winner
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(answer, salt)) == commitments[msg.sender]);
        determineWinner(msg.sender, answer);
    }
}
```

#### **GuildSystem.sol** - Community Management
```solidity
// Guild formation with treasury and group battles
contract GuildSystem {
    struct Guild {
        string name;
        address[] members;
        uint256 treasury;
        uint256 wins;
        uint256 totalEarnings;
    }
    
    function createGuild(string memory name) external payable {
        // Guild registration with initial treasury
        require(msg.value >= MIN_TREASURY, "Insufficient initial treasury");
        guilds[guildId] = Guild(name, [msg.sender], msg.value, 0, 0);
    }
    
    function contributeToTreasury(uint256 guildId) external payable {
        // Treasury funding by guild members
        guilds[guildId].treasury += msg.value;
        emit TreasuryContributed(guildId, msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
    
    function startGuildBattle(uint256 guild1, uint256 guild2) external payable {
        // Guild vs Guild battle with prize pool
        require(msg.value >= MIN_BATTLE_PRIZE, "Insufficient prize pool");
        battles[battleId] = Battle(guild1, guild2, msg.value, BattleState.Active);
    }
}
```

#### **QuizNFT.sol** - Creator Economy
```solidity
// NFT quiz creator with EIP-2981 royalties
contract QuizNFT is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, IERC2981 {
    struct Quiz {
        string title;
        address creator;
        uint256 playFee;
        uint256 royaltyPercent;
        uint256 playCount;
        uint256 totalEarnings;
        string ipfsHash;
    }
    
    function mintQuiz(
        string memory title,
        uint256 playFee,
        uint256 royaltyPercent,
        string memory ipfsHash
    ) external returns (uint256) {
        // NFT creation with royalty setup
        uint256 tokenId = nextTokenId++;
        quizzes[tokenId] = Quiz(title, msg.sender, playFee, royaltyPercent, 0, 0, ipfsHash);
        _mint(msg.sender, tokenId);
    }
    
    function playQuiz(uint256 tokenId, uint256 score) external payable {
        // Quiz playing with automatic royalty distribution
        Quiz storage quiz = quizzes[tokenId];
        require(msg.value >= quiz.playFee, "Insufficient payment");
        
        uint256 royaltyAmount = (msg.value * quiz.royaltyPercent) / 10000;
        (bool success, ) = quiz.creator.call{value: royaltyAmount}("");
        require(success, "Royalty payment failed");
        
        quiz.playCount++;
        quiz.totalEarnings += msg.value;
    }
    
    function royaltyInfo(uint256 tokenId, uint256 salePrice) 
        external view override returns (address, uint256) {
        // EIP-2981 royalty standard implementation
        address creator = quizzes[tokenId].creator;
        uint256 royaltyAmount = (salePrice * quizzes[tokenId].royaltyPercent) / 10000;
        return (creator, royaltyAmount);
    }
}
